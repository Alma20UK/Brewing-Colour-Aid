# Brewing-Colour-Aid
An app I made to aid brewers in the process of assigning an 'SRM' colour value to their beers.

SRM refers to Standard Reference Method, which is a colour based measurement brewers can use when determing the style of their beers.

This app was made after speaking with a friend of mine who owns a brewery, who explained how an app of this nature could be useful.

Moving the scroll bar on the site allows an individual to change the background colour of the website.

The range input has 40 separate values, each linked to an actual SRM colour value which is also updated when scrolling.
